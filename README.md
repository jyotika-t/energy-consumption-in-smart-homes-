Energy Consumption and Conservation in Smart Homes
Overview
This project focuses on predicting and optimizing energy consumption in smart homes using machine learning models and rule-based comfort optimization. It provides APIs to analyze household data, predict future energy usage, and suggest conservation strategies, making it suitable for smart home automation systems and IoT integration.

The solution is packaged with Docker for easy deployment and includes a Jupyter Notebook for exploratory data analysis, feature engineering, and model training.

Features
Energy Usage Prediction: Uses machine learning models to forecast household energy consumption.
Comfort Model: Balances energy saving with maintaining user comfort levels.
Mobility Profiling: Learns occupant behavior to optimize device usage patterns.
Data Compression (LZ Trie): Implements an efficient compression algorithm for storage/transmission.
REST API: Endpoints for prediction and recommendations.
Automated Deployment: Supports Docker and docker-compose for containerized environments.
CI/CD Workflow: GitHub Actions pipeline for automated builds and testing.
